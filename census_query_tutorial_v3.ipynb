    "This program demonstrates how Python (along with the census library, available at https://github.com/datamade/census) can be used to retrieve and export US Census data at the zip code, county, and state level. Although this tutorial program will focus on gathering education, family type, and income/poverty statistics from the American Community Survey, it should be a useful reference for those wishing to gather other types of census data instead.\n",

    "The next step was to locate the source of the data that I was interested in. For this program, I chose to retrieve zip code statistics for the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Household types (mostly married households vs. ones led by a female householder with no spouse present, which, for brevity's sake, I'll abbreviate as 'female-householder' homes.\n",
    "2. The presence of children within these households\n",
    "3. Median household income\n",
    "4. Poverty status by family type\n",
    "5. Poverty status by family type and the highest level of education completed\n",
    "\n",
    "To search for this data, I used the Census's API site (https://api.census.gov/data.html). This is a very helpful site that provides links to different data sources, along with lists of groups and variables within those data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to access data from the 2019 American Community Survey, I searched in the above page in my web browser for 'acs5', then found the most recent year--which, in this case, happened to be 2019. To confirm that I could access data at the zip code level within this table, I could click on the 'geography' hyperlink (https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/geography.html). To figure out what types of data this survey provides, I clicked on its 'groups' hyperlink (https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/groups.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This groups page had 1,136 (!) different types of data that I could choose from. Fortunately, there were lots of options available for my variables of interest (marriage, income, education, household type, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Census data site also provided an 'examples' page for accessing American Community Survey data (https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/examples.html), although the query format I used differed somewhat from the examples shown there.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to query Census data in this program by:\n",
    "1. Organizing different queries in dictionaries\n",
    "2. Adding these dictionaries to a list (which I named 'metric_list')\n",
    "3. Looping through this list\n",
    "4. Storing the output of the queries in a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two steps are shown below. I ended up adding many different queries to my dictionary, but you may choose to retrieve data for only a couple variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dictionary is based off information available on the Census Data page for a particular 'group.' For instance, to find data on the presence of children in households by household type, I chose to look into table B11005, 'HOUSEHOLDS BY PRESENCE OF PEOPLE UNDER 18 YEARS BY HOUSEHOLD TYPE' (which can be found on https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/groups.html). Clicking the 'selected variables' link for that group took me to https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/groups/B11005.html. This page shows all the different statistics available for the 'HOUSEHOLDS BY PRESENCE OF PEOPLE UNDER 18 YEARS BY HOUSEHOLD TYPE' group.\n",
    "\n",
    "I stored the following information from these pages within the dictionaries below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'Name': the code on the Census website for that particular variable (e.g. B11005_001E). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. 'Label': the Census's text description of that variable (e.g. 'Estimate!!Total:')\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 'Concept': the Census's text description of the group to which the variable belongs (e.g. 'HOUSEHOLDS BY PRESENCE OF PEOPLE UNDER 18 YEARS BY HOUSEHOLD TYPE''). \n",
    "\n",
    "I also added an 'Alias' key to store my own description of these metrics. These aliases then served as column names in the Pandas DataFrame that stored the results of these queries. That DataFrame will appear later in this program.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could have made the dictionaries simpler by including only the 'Name' and 'Alias' components, as the 'Label' and 'Concept' keys are neither used in the census queries nor displayed in the table. However, they can serve as a helpful reference for distinguishing between subtly different variable types."

However, suppose not all the kids identified in Table A show up in Table B, and that Table B doesn't have a totals row. In that case, you'd want to divide the proportion of kids in Table B above below the poverty level (2,000) by the number in Table B above the poverty level (let's say it's 6,000) to arrive at a more accurate proportion--in this case, 2,000/(2,000+6,000) = 2,000/8,000 = 25%.)"
